## 📋 What to Do - Step by Step

### STEP 1: Confirm It's Real (First 10 minutes)

**Check these things:**
- Who accessed the data? (username, system)
- What data was accessed? (files, databases, records)
- When did it happen? (date and time)
- Where did the data go? (email, USB, cloud, download)
- How much data? (number of files, GB, records)

**Quick questions to ask:**
- Is this normal for this user?
- Did they have permission to access this data?
- Is the data sensitive?
- Can we see where it went?

**Create a ticket and write down:**
...
INCIDENT #: [Number]
TIME DETECTED: [Date/Time]
USER INVOLVED: [Username]
DATA TYPE: [What kind of data]
ESTIMATED SIZE: [How much]
MY NAME: [Your name]
...

------------------------------------------------------------------

### STEP 2: Stop the Bleeding (Next 15 minutes)

**Do these things FAST:**

1. **Stop active data theft**
   - Disable the user account
   - Block the destination (IP, website, email)
   - Disconnect system from network if needed

2. **Save evidence**
   - Export logs NOW (they may disappear)
   - Take screenshots
   - Note everything you see

3. **Prevent more damage**
   - Change passwords for affected accounts
   - Revoke access tokens/API keys
   - Check if other accounts are compromised

**Commands to disable user:**
```powershell
# Windows
Disable-ADAccount -Identity USERNAME

# Linux
usermod -L USERNAME
.....

**Commands to block IP:**
....bash
# Block bad IP
iptables -A OUTPUT -d MALICIOUS_IP -j DROP
...

-------------------------------------------------------

### STEP 3: Figure Out What Happened (Next 1-2 hours)

**What to investigate:**

**Check User Activity:**
- When did they last login? From where?
- What files did they open/download?
- Did they email files or upload to cloud?
- Did they use USB drives?
- Any unusual behavior in past week?

**Check Data Movement:**
- Large file downloads?
- Emails with attachments sent?
- Cloud uploads (Dropbox, Google Drive)?
- Database exports?
- Compressed files created (.zip)?

**Check Systems:**
- Which computers were used?
- Any malware found?
- Were logs deleted?
- Any backdoors installed?

**Simple SIEM searches:**
...
# Find large downloads by user
user=USERNAME bytes > 10000000

# Find file access by user
user=USERNAME action=download OR action=access

# Find cloud uploads
url contains "dropbox" OR url contains "drive.google"
...

**Make a timeline:**
...
2:30 PM - User logged in from home
2:35 PM - Accessed HR database
2:40 PM - Downloaded 1000 employee records
2:45 PM - Created zip file
2:50 PM - Uploaded to personal Dropbox
2:55 PM - Deleted zip file
...

----------------------------------------------------------------
