# Ransomware Response Playbook

## Severity: CRITICAL

## Objective
Rapidly contain ransomware infection, prevent spread, and restore operations with minimal data loss.

## Detection Indicators
- File encryption activity
- Ransom notes (text files, wallpaper changes)
- Unusual file extensions (.encrypted, .locked, etc.)
- Mass file modifications
- Network share access anomalies
- Backup deletion attempts

## Immediate Actions (0-15 minutes)
1. Isolate affected systems from network
2. Identify patient zero and infection vector
3. Notify incident response team and management
4. Document initial observations with timestamps
5. Preserve evidence (memory dumps, logs)

## Investigation Phase (15-60 minutes)
1. Identify ransomware variant
2. Map affected systems and data
3. Check backup integrity
4. Analyze network logs for lateral movement
5. Identify all compromised credentials

## Containment
1. Disconnect affected systems
2. Block C2 communication at firewall
3. Disable compromised accounts
4. Segment network to prevent spread
5. Monitor for additional infections

## Eradication
1. Remove ransomware artifacts
2. Patch vulnerabilities
3. Reset compromised credentials
4. Update security controls
5. Verify clean state

## Recovery
1. Restore from clean backups
2. Rebuild affected systems if necessary
3. Gradually reconnect to network
4. Monitor for re-infection
5. Validate data integrity

## Post-Incident
1. Conduct root cause analysis
2. Update security controls
3. Review and update playbook
4. Provide user awareness training
5. File insurance claim if applicable

** Other considerations are are also:
 1. Have a Security Retainer with an advising security consultant
 2. POC solutions that can give you true visbility on the actual details of the ransomware attack
 3. Optimize your exisitng stack for backups, golden images, immutable backups, recoveries, and test, test, test you recoveries!!!!
